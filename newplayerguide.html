        <h1>A new player guide to peak!</h1>
        <p>
            Peak is generally a game about failing and improving on each consecutive session the goal of your expedition
            may differ but will always result in you attempting to reach the top of the mountain otherwise known as the
            peak.

        <p>
            The game does help the player by leaving hints and nudges in the right direction via hints and items for
            example the players can find the scout handbook which is located within the crash site at the start of the
            game, I highly advise giving it a read through at the start of the run to familierise yourself ith peaks
            many mechanics and challenges
