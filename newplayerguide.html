        <h2>A new player guide to peak!</h2>
        <p>
            Peak is generally a game about failing and improving on each consecutive session the goal of your expedition
            may differ but will always result in you attempting to reach the top of the mountain otherwise known as the
            peak.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game does help the player by leaving hints and nudges in the right direction via hints and items for
            example the players can find the scout handbook which is located within the crash site at the start of the
            game, I highly advise giving it a read through at the start of the run to familierise yourself with peaks
            many mechanics and challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the player starts a new game they will find themself located within the games hub "The Airport" the
            player can customise the appeareance of their scout here aswell as test out the games mechanics and physics
            by climbing there surroundings especially the main rock climbing wall, this is also the area you can invite
            your friends before starting. The player will then navigate through the hub and find themself at the
            terminal which will allow the player to select the difficulty of there expedition and set off.
        </p>

        <p>
            The game begins once the player crash lands on the "shores" biome your main objective once crash landing is
            too loot any luggage, food or items you may come across in your journey to the top of the mountain. The
            player will be tasked with climbing through a variety of unique and difficult biomes before eventually
            lighting a flare to escape the island at the peak.
