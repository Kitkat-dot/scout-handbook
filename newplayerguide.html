                <h2>A new player guide to peak!</h2>
                <p>
                    Peak is generally a game about failing and improving on each consecutive session the goal of your
                    expedition may differ but will always result in you attempting to reach the top of the mountain
                    otherwise known as the peak.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game does help the player by leaving hints and nudges in the right direction via hints and items
                    for example the players can find the scout handbook which is located within the crash site at the
                    start of the game, I highly advise giving it a read through at the start of the run to familierise
                    yourself with peaks many mechanics and challenges.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once the player starts a new game they will find themself located within the games hub "The Airport"
                    the player can customise the appeareance of their scout here aswell as test out the games mechanics
                    and physics by climbing there surroundings especially the main rock climbing wall, this is also the
                    area you can invite your friends before starting. The player will then navigate through the hub and
                    find themself at the terminal which will allow the player to select the difficulty of there
                    expedition and set off.
                </p>
                <img class="luggage" src="images/Loading%20Screen.png" alt="Loading Screen image"/>
                <p>
                    The game begins once the player crash lands on the "shores" biome your main objective once crash
                    landing is too loot any luggage, food or items you may come across in your journey to the top of the
                    mountain. The player will be tasked with climbing through a variety of unique and difficult biomes
                    before eventually lighting a flare to escape the island at the peak.
